## Building

This library requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) v10.3.0 or higher, mostly to support
[Regular Expression Named Capture Groups](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-named-groups).
See [this page](https://node.green/) for NodeJS ES2018 support.

You can build this library by running:

* `npm run build`

The outputs will all be in `dist`.

* `dist/x509.min.js` is the library for the web browser, which is minified.
* `dist/index.js` is the root of the NodeJS library, which is not minified.
